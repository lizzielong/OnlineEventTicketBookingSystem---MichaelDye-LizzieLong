Online Event Ticket Booking System
Team size: Two 

Please create a Github repository for the project.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and implement an Online Event Ticket Booking System. The system allows:
- Customers to browse events, book tickets, cancel reservations, and view history.
- Administrators to add and manage events, configure ticketing, and generate sales reports.

This project is designed to give students hands-on experience in software requirements, design, coding, testing, and documentation.

Functional Requirements
User Roles: Customer, Administrator.
2. Authentication: Login system with role-based access.
3. Customer Features:

Suggested Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or React/Angular).
- Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Java (Spring).
- Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL (or SQLite for prototype).

Deliverables
- Requirements Specification (SRS) including use cases and user stories.
- System Design: UML class diagrams, sequence diagrams, ER diagrams.
